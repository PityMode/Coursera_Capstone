Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury.\n\nRoad traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.\n\n[Source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries)"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## What can be done to address road traffic injuries\nRoad traffic injuries can be prevented. Governments need to take action to address road safety holistically. This requires involvement from multiple sectors such as transport, police, health, education, and actions that address roads, vehicles, and road users' safety.\n\nEffective interventions include designing safer infrastructure and incorporating road safety features into land-use and transport planning, improving vehicles' safety features, improving post-crash care for victims of road crashes, setting and enforcing laws relating to key risks, and raising public awareness.\n\nBy implementing road safety prediction applications, we can achieve several goals:\n\n- Enlight for the local officials points where they need to assemble their resources for more effective service on the road.\n- Implement road drivers warnings about road traffic conditions.\n- Using predictive information for regulating speed limits on the road.\n\nIn conclusion, we will prevent incidents rather than spending resources on the treatment of their conferences."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
